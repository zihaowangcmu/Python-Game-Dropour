Hi!
To run the game, just run '__init__.py' and you are good!
The game Dropour is a puzzle game! The goal of the game is to reach all stars each level! Then you are done!

*HOW TO PLAY?
1.Press w/a/s/d to control the movement of the water drop to up/left/down/right.
2.When you are moving, the drop is not controllable until it stops.
3.The water drop stops if it meets a block(maybe a brick, a triggered trap or a sipike with no tip.)
4.Try to avoid the bombs and spikes!
5.Wormholes and rings will teleport you to another location.

*BUILD YOUR EXCLUSIVE MAP!
On the menu, click the BUILD MY MAZE button and follow the instructions to build a map.

Once you finished the map, just click the left bottom PLAY MY MAP button, and play it!

*REVIEW YOUR STEPS AND IMPROVE!
After clear the level, you can click on playback to review your steps. Once click on it, 
just stay your hands off the keyboard and see what you just did! Also, your steps, movement and
time will be displayed on the screen.

*CHECK HELP TO LEARN MORE.
Click the HELP button and see more information.

*ANOTHER THING.
Since the bgm is large in size, I didn't upload that. I sent it to my mentor.
Because the bgm can't be played, I comment that line. If you want to have the bgm,
please get the 'bgm.wav' from Joseph and put it in the folder 'sound', then 
uncomment the 290th line in '__init__.py'.
